We are looking for traslations help!
If you are able, please fork this repo and create a pull request to add your language.  

Each language is in a locale folder ([/en-us for example](https://github.com/evantahler/old-browser.org/blob/gh-pages/en-us/index.html)).  All that is required is that you provide localized strings in YML document.

Thanks!
